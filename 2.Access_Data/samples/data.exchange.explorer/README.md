# Description

This sample is extending the sample (with same name) from tutorial 1 sample pack. Was added the ability to get in Forge Viewer context the stats on assets and relationships related to visualized exchange, as well as download them for further client side processing.

The main changes were made to two files:

1. The [dataexchange](./routes/dataexchange.js) added several new backend routs responsible for all Data Exchange API calls;
2. The [FDX_Explorer extension](public/js/fdx_explorer.js), added a new button, panel and ability to download the results.

# Setup

## Prerequisites

1. **Forge Account**: Learn how to create a Forge Account, activate subscription and create an app at [this tutorial](http://learnforge.autodesk.io/#/account/). 
2. **Visual Code**: Visual Code (Windows or MacOS).
3. **JavaScript ES6** syntax for server-side
4. **JavaScript** basic knowledge with **jQuery**


For using this sample, you need an Autodesk developer credentials. Visit the [Forge Developer Portal](https://developer.autodesk.com), sign up for an account, then [create an app](https://developer.autodesk.com/myapps/create). For this new app, use **http://localhost:3000/api/forge/callback/oauth** as Callback URL, although is not used on 2-legged flow. Finally take note of the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

## Running locally

Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org), version 8 or newer.

Clone this project or download it (this `nodejs` branch only). It's recommended to install [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). To clone it via command line, use the following (**Terminal** on MacOSX/Linux, **Git Shell** on Windows):

    git clone -b nodejs https://github.com/Autodesk-Forge/learn.forge.viewhubmodels.git

To run it, install the required packages, set the enviroment variables with your client ID & secret and finally start it. Via command line, navigate to the folder where this repository was cloned and use the following:

Mac OSX/Linux (Terminal)

    npm install
    export FORGE_CLIENT_ID=<<YOUR CLIENT ID FROM DEVELOPER PORTAL>>
    export FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=<<YOUR CLIENT SECRET>>
    export FORGE_CALLBACK_URL=<<YOUR CALLBACK URL>>
    npm start

Windows (use **Node.js command line** from Start menu)

    npm install
    set FORGE_CLIENT_ID=<<YOUR CLIENT ID FROM DEVELOPER PORTAL>>
    set FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=<<YOUR CLIENT SECRET>>
    set FORGE_CALLBACK_URL=<<YOUR CALLBACK URL>>
    npm start

Open the browser: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Packages used

The [Autodesk Forge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forge-apis) packages is included by default. Some other non-Autodesk packaged are used, including [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) for upload.

### Tips & Tricks

For local development/testing, consider use [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) package, which auto restart your node application after any modification on your code. To install it, use:

    sudo npm install -g nodemon

Then, instead of **npm run dev**, use the following:

    npm run nodemon

Which executes **nodemon server.js --ignore www/**, where the **--ignore** parameter indicates that the app should not restart if files under **www** folder are modified.

### Troubleshooting

After installing Github desktop for Windows, on the Git Shell, if you see a ***error setting certificate verify locations*** error, use the following:

    git config --global http.sslverify "false"
